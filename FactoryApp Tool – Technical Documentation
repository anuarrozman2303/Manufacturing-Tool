# Components
## **Admin Login Component**
This is a simple Tkinter-based admin login interface. The component provides a basic password authentication mechanism with encryption.
### Features:
1. **Password Entry**: Users can input a password in a masked field.
2. **Password Validation**: The hardcoded password "admin" is checked. If correct, it encrypts the password and saves it to a file.
3. **Encryption**: The password is ecrypted using the `cryptography.fernet` library and saved to `password.txt`.
### File Overview:
1. **secret.key**: Stores the encryption key for password encryption.
2. **password.txt**: Stores the encrypted password.
### Usage:
1. To use the component, instantiate `AdminLoginApp` with a Tkinter master window and a caller object.
2. The component is unused and can be incorporated into an app for password protection.
### Note:
This component is not currently active in app and is provided for future use if admin login functionality is needed.

## **AHT20 Sensor**
The `aht20Sensor` module handles temperature and humidity readings using the AHT20 sensor. It acts as a wrapper around the AHT20 class (imported from local module) and formats the output for display or logging purposes.
### Purpose:
This component is responsible for:
- Initializing the AHT20 sensor.
- Reading temperature and humidity data.
- Formatting the output into human-readable strings with units.
### File: `aht20Sensor.py`
**Class:** `SensorLogger`

`__init__(self)`
- Instantiates the AHT20 sensor by creating and object of the AHT20 class.

`read_temp_sensor(self)`
- Reads temperature from the sensor.
- Returns a formatted string like: `"24.56 °C"`

`read_humid_sensor(self)`
- Reads humidity from the sensor.
- Returns a formatted string like: `"63.21 %RH"`
### Dependencies
1. Relies on the local AHT20 module (AHT20.py) which must contain the actual sensor communication logic.
2. Uses Python's logging module for logging purposes (though not heavily used in the current implementation).

## **Command Window**
The `commandWindow.py` module provides a simple Tkinter-based settings interface for inputting and saving device-specific parameters like Serial Number and Device ID. These values are stored in a configuration file (`sendCommand.ini`) for later use by other parts of the application.

### Purpose
The component allows users to:
- View and edit the device Serial Number and Device ID.
- Save the settings persistently in a `.ini` file format.

### File: `commandWindow.py`
**Class:** `CommandWindow`

`__init__(self, master)`
- Initializes the window and UI elements.
- Load existing settings from `sendCommand.ini` if available.

`create_widgets(self)`
- Creates and lays out the Tkinter input fields and buttons:
  - Serial Number Entry
  - Device ID Entry
  - Save Button

`load_settings(self)`
- Reads and populates the entry fields with previously saved values from the `[SETTINGS]` section in `sendCommand.ini`.

`save_settings(self)`
- Save current input values into the `.ini` file under the `[SETTINGS]` section.
- Closes the window after saving.

### Configuration File
- Path: `sendCommand.ini`
- Format:
`[SETTINGS]`
 `SerialNumber = Your_Serial`
 `DeviceID = Your_Device_ID`

## **DMM Reader**
The `dmmReader.py` module handles USB-based multimeter detection and data reading for supported devices (mainly UT61E+ series via HID). It interfaces with the GUI to display voltage measurements (3.3V and 5V) from connected meters and writes results to a file.
### Purpose
- Detects USB HID-connected multimeter (CP2110 and QinHeng-based).
- Reads voltage values.
- Routes measured data to GUI entry fields and a text file.
### Dependencies
- `hid` (via `hidapi`)
- `tkinter`
- `UT61EPLUS` class from `components/dmmReader/ut61eplus.py`
- Python logging and basic file operations.
### Class: `DeviceSelectionApp`

`__init__(self, parent_frame, status_label1, status_label2)`
- Initializes with parent GUI frame and two status entry fields.
- Calls `create_widgets()`.

`create_widgets(self)`
- Builds UI:
  - Multimeter label.
  - Hidden refresh button (intended for debugging/dev).
  - Device button panel (dynamically populated later).

`refresh_devices(self)`
- Scan USB ports for supported multimeters (CP2110 and QinHeng).
- Appends found devices to `self.devices` list.
- Updates the device button panel via `update_device_buttons()`.

`update_device_buttons(self)`
- Clears and re-creates buttons for each detected multimeter.
- Each button links to its device index via `select_device()`.

`select_device(self, device_number)`
- Creates a `UT61EPLUS` object for the selected index.
- Triggers measurement via `read_multimeter()`.

`read_multimeter(self, device_number)`
- Opens communication with the selected meter.
- Takes a measurement and logs it.
- Writes result to `dmm_output.txt`.
- Populates the voltage into `status_label1` (3.3V) or `status_label2` (5V) based on the index.

`insert_3_3V_dmm2entry(self, volt)`
- Clears and sets value in the first entry field (3.3V).

`insert_5V_dmm2entry(self, volt)`
- Clears and sets value in the second entry field (5V).

`check_voltage(self, voltage)`
- Determines if the voltage is a valid 3.3V or 5V reading.
- Updates the appropriate entry field (legacy/debug usage).

`is_3_3_voltage(self, voltage)`
- Returns `True` if voltage is in loose 3.3V range (`1.00V - 5.00V`).

`is_5_voltage(self, voltage)`
- Returns `True` if voltage is in loose 5 range (`3.00V - 7.00V`).

## **Certificate Flashing Handler**
This module is responsible for managing the secure certificate flashing process onto ESP32-S3 devices. It's built to handle both development and production environments and supports flashing via `esptool.py` or `OpenOCD`, depending on configuration.

### Main Responsibilities
- **Flash secure certificates** (`_esp_secure_cert.bin`) and corresponding partition binaries (`-partition.bin`) to target devices.
- **Track used certificates** to prevent reuse by storing them in a local file (`used_cert_ids.pkl`).
- **Handle different flashing tools**:
   - `esptool.py` for UART-based flashing.
   - `OpenOCD` for USB-JTAG-based flashing.

### Certificate Structure
Assumes certificate files are located in:
`../../certs/<serialnumber>/espsecurecert/out/<foldername>/<uuid>/`

Expected file formats:
- `<uuid>_esp_secure_cert.bin`
- `<uuid>-partition.bin`

### Key Methods
- `flash_certificates(...)`
Main entry point to start the flashing process. Validate files, calls the correct flashing command, updates GUI labels, and log results.
- `certify(...)`
Executes actual flashing command based on selected tool and mode.
- `get_cert_ids_for_order(...)`
Filters cert IDs based on selected order number.
- `get_qrcode_for_cert_id(...)`
Returns the QR code associated with a given cert ID.
- `get_manualcode_for_cert_id(...)`
Returns the manual code associated with a given cert ID.
- `get_flashing_esp32s3_cert_status()`
Parses logs to update GUI with flash status.
- `get_remaining_cert_ids(...)`
Returns cert IDs that haven't been flashed yet.

### Flashing Tool Paths
Hardcoded OpenOCD config paths:
`openocd_esp_usb_jtag_cfg_path = "<path-to>/esp_usb_jtag.cfg"`
`openocd_esp32s3_builtin_cfg_path = "<path-to>/esp32s3-builtin.cfg"`

## **Flashing ESP32 Devices**
This module handles firmware flashing for ESP32-S3 and ESP32-H2 devices. It supports two flashing modes:
- **esptool.py (UART)**
- **OpenOCD (JTAG/USB)**

The tool dynamically detects the target chip, locates required `.bin` file based on keywords, flashes them to the appropriate memory addresses, and provides real-time feedback through the GUI.

### Flashing Logic
Flashing behavior is determined by:
- `use_esptool`: `True` = flash via `esptool.py`, else use `OpenOCD`
- `chip_type`: Auto-detected as `esp32s3` or `esp32h2`

The selected port and method determine which internal function is triggered:
```
if use_septool:
   flash_esp32s3_with_esptool(...)
else:
   flash_esp32s3_with_openocd(...)
```

### Firmware File Discovery
Instead of hardcoding firmware paths, the system dynamically searches for `.bin` files based on keywords.

**Example:**
```
find_bin_path('bootloader', '/path/to/firmware')
```
This returns the first `.bin` file containing `'bootloader'` in its name. Used to find:
- `bootloader`
- `partition`
- `app/application`
- `ota`
- `factory`

### Functions
`flash_esp32s3_wtih_esptool(selected_port, label, firmware_path)`

Flashes ESP32-S3 using esptool. Parses progress using regex (`r"(\d+)%"`), updates GUI label in real time.

Verify success with:
```
if "Hash of data verified." in output
```

1. `flash_esp32h2_with_esptool(selected_port, label, firmware_path)`

    Similar to the S3 function. Also extracts MAC address from:
    ```
    MAC Address: <MAC>
    ```
   The MAC is stored in `esp32h2_mac_address.

2. `flash_esp32s3_with_openocd(selected_port, label)`

    Flashes ESP32-S3 using OpenOCD with a chip config. Uses:
    ```
    source /esp-idf/export.sh
    openocd -f board/esp32s3-builtin.cfg -c "program_esp ..."
    ```

3. `flash_esp32h2_with_openocd(selected_port, label)`

    Same as above, but uses:
    ```
    openocd -f board/esp32h2-builtin.cfg
    ```

### Output Parsing & Feedback
Each function:
- Reads process output line by line.
- Updates GUI label based on real-time flashing progress.
- Detects success/failure and reflects result visually.

If flashing fails or hangs:
- Process output is still captured.
- Label turns red to indicate failure.
- Output is logged for debugging.

### Important Notes
- `subprocess.terminate()` has been removed - it was killing process premature. Now replaced with:
  ``` 
  process.stdout.close()
  process.wait()
  ```
- Global variables (like `esp32h2_mac_address`) should eventually be removed in favor of instances variables or returns.
- Do not use hardcoded paths like `/usr/sr/app/...`. Use `os.getenv` or config files.
- Flashing logic runs on a separate thread to keep GUI responsive.

## **Load Test Script (INI Parser)**
### Overview
This component is responsible for reading and parsing `.ini` configuration files. It's used to load structured test scripts or configuration data needed during the flashing or validation processes.

Built on Python's built-in `configparser` module, this class helps modularize test settings and organize them by sections and key-value pairs.

### Purpose
- Load `.ini` files containing test instructions or parameters.
- Print all sections and their key-value pairs for inspection.
- Designed for use with structured automation flows.

### Class: `LoadTestScript`
**Constructor**

`def __init__(self, ini_file_path)`
- **ini_file_path**: Full path to the `.ini` file to be loaded.
- Loads the file and initializes a `ConfigParser` object.

**Method:** `load_script()`

`def load_script(self)`
- Iterates through all sections in the `.ini` file.
- Prints each section and its respective options with values.

### Example Usage
```
script_loader = LoadTestScript("/path/to/test_config.ini")
script_loader.load_script()
```

### Notes
- This version only **prints** the config values. It does not return or store them.
- For actual logic execution, you'll likely need to:
   - Add methods to retrieve specific values.
   - Convert values to correct data type (`int`, `float`, `bool`, etc).
   - Add error handling for malformed `.ini` files or missing fields.

## **Manual Test GUI (`manualtest.py`)**
### Overview
This component provides a **Tkinter-based GUI** window for manual testing. It dynamically generated buttons based on the contents of a `manual_test.ini` file. Each button corresponds to a command, which is sent through a predefined function when clicked.

### Class: `ManualTestApp`
**Constructor**
`def __init__(self, root, send_command)`
- **root**: The main `tk.Tk()` instance or a reference to the parent window.
- **send_command**: A callback function that handles sending the selected command (e.g., through a serial interface).

### Method: `open_manual_test_window()`
Creates and opens a new window titled **Manual Test**.
- Automatically searches the system for a `manual_test.ini` file.
- If found, loads its sections and keys into a set of labeled buttons.
- If not found, prints a message to the console.

### Method: `find_manual_test_ini(start_dir)`
Recursively searches for `manual_test.ini` starting from the given directory.

`config_path = self.find_manual_test_ini("/")`
- Searches **every subdirectory**, so be cautious of performance on large file systems.
- Returns the full path of the `.ini` file if found; otherwise, returns `None`.

### Method: `create_buttons_from_config(config, parent)`
Creates a button for each key in each section of the `.ini` file.
- Each section becomes a `LabelFrame`.
- Each key-value pair becomes a button.
- On click, the value with `\r\n` appended) is passed to `send_command`.

### Method: `load_config(filename)
Loads and returns a `ConfigParser object for the specified file.

### Usage Example
```
root - tk.Tk()
manual_app = ManualTestApp(root, send_command=your_send_function)
manual_app.open_manual_test_window()
```

### Notes
- The search for `manual_test.ini` starts from `/` by default.
- `\r\n` is appended to commands for compatibility with serial protocols.
- No error handling for invalid `.ini` format - should be added for production.

## **Order Number Extractor (`processOrderNumber.py`)**
### Overview
This minimal component is responsible for extracting a **unique list of order numbers** from a list of order dictionaries. It ensures that duplicate order numbers are removed using Python`s `set` data structure.

### Function: `get_order_numbers(orders)`
**Signature**
`def get_order_numbers(orders):`

**Parameters**
- **orders:** A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary is expected to have an `'order-no'` key.
  ```
  [
     {"order-no": "ORD001", "other-info": "..."},
     {"order-no": "ORD002", "other-info": "..."},
  ]
  ```

**Returns**
- A list of unique order numbers:
  ```
  ['ORD001', 'ORD002']
  ```

### How It Works
- Uses a generator expression inside `set()` to extract all `order-no` values.
- Converts the set back to a list before returning.
- No guaranteed order due to use of `set`.

### To-Do / Improvements
- Consider returning a **sorted list** for consistently display:
  ```
  return sorted(set(order['order-no'] for order in orders))
  ```
- Add error handling to manage missing `'order-no'` keys 9e.g., using `.get()` with a fallback or validation step. 

## **Order File Reader (`readOrderFile.py`)**
### Overview
This component is designed to **parse a structured text file** containing order data. Each line in the file represents a single order, with key-value pairs separated by commas and colons. The output is a list of dictionaries, each representing an order.

### Function: `parse_order_file(file_path)`
**Signature**
`def parse_order_file(file_path):`

**Parameters**
- **file_path:** A `str` - the path to the `.txt` file that contains order information.

**Returns**
- **List of dictionaries** if parsing successful.
   ```
   [
      {"order-no": "ORD001", "cert-id": "001"},
      {"order-no": "ORD002", "cert-id": "002"},
   ]
   ```
- **Empty string** ("") if the file is missing or can't be parsed.

### Input File Format
Each line in the file should follow this structure:
```
order-no: ORD001, cert-id: 001
order-no: ORD002, cert-id: 002
```
### How It Works
1. Reads all lines from the given file.
2. Splits each line into key-value pairs using `split(',')` and `split(': ',1)`.
3. Builds a dictionary for each line.
4. Appends each dictionary to a list, which gets returned.

### Example Usage
```
orders = parse_order_file("/home/user/order.txt")
print(orders)
```

### Limitations & Improvements
- No validation on malformed lines or missing keys.
- Consider trimming whitespace or handling mssing `:` more robustly.
- Not safe for large files - could benefit from streaming or line-by-line yield.
- Error message is generic - could provide more specific exception details.

## **GPIO Reboot Controller - `RebootPinS3`**
### Overview
This component controls the **hardware reboot** of an ESP32-S3 board by toggling a specified **GPIO** pin on a **Raspberry Pi**. It's designed for factory tools or testing environments where rebooting the device through hardware is needed.

### Class: `RebootPinS3`
**Constructor**

`def __init__(self, gpio_pin=18):`

**Parameters**
- `gpio_pin` (int): GPIO pin number in **BCM mode** used for rebooting the ESP32-S3. Default is **GPIO 18**.

### Methods
1. `set_pin_high()`
Sets the GPIO pin to HIGH. 
   ```
   reboot_pin.set_pin_high()
   ```
2. `set_pin_low()`
Sets the GPIO pin to LOW.
   ```
   reboot_pin.set_pin_low()
   ```
3. `reboot_esp32()`
Performs a hardware reboot by toggling the pin:
   - HIGH
   - Wait 1 second
   - LOW
   - Wait 1 second
   - HIGH

   ```
   reboot_pin.reboot_esp32()
   ```
4. `cleanup()`
Cleans up the GPIO state after use.
   ```
   reboot_pin.cleanup()
   ```

### Notes
- **BCM Pin Mode**: Make sure you're using BCM pin numbers (`GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)`).
- **GPIO Cleanup** is critical to prevent conflicts on repeated runs.
- You **must run this with root privileges** (e.g., `sudo`) to control GPIO on Raspberry Pi.

### Improvement Ideas
- Add configurable timing (e.g., reboot delay).
- Add status feedback to confirm pin toggling.
- Wrap in a try-finally block to ensure cleanup happens even on crash.

## **Serial Communication `serialCom`**
### Overview
The `SerialCom` class handles serial communication between the Python application and a connected device (e.g., ESP32 or similar embedded hardware). It reads, processes, and acts on various serial messages in real time. The class is designed to support a test or factory tool GUI with multiple status labels for test feedback. 

Key features include:
- Opening and closing serial ports.
- Background thread for real-time serial data reading.
- Decoding and parsing different device responses (e.g., MAC, FW, product name, sensor data).
- Updating GUI labels based on test results.
- Handling factory mode logic.

### Purpose
The class is used to:
- Establish and manage a serial connection with a device under test (DUT).
- Read and interpret serial data to validate device status, configurations, and sensor readings.
- Automatically trigger actions like sending commands when a certain device state is detected.
- Provide live test results in the GUI using 25 individual status labels.

This class plays a critical role in the automated test workflow within a factory or engineering setup.

### Notes
- **Status Labels**: The constructor accepts 25 GUI labels to reflect different test statuses. This tight coupling with the GUI could make unit testing harder.
- **Global Variables**: 
   - `device_factory_mode`, `factory_mode_counter`, `abnormal_dot_counter`, `exit_read_thread` are **global**, which isn't ideal. Consider encapsulating these into instance variables or a state manager.
- **Thread Safety**: Although it uses threading for reading serial data, there's no locking around shared state. Race conditions could occur.
- **Exception Handling**: It gracefully handles `SerialException`, `UnicodeDecodeError`, and generic `Exception` during reads.
- **Hardcoded String Matching**: Parsing is done using fixed strings (e.g., `"3;MAC? = "`), which could break if the firmware format changes.
- **Temporary Blocks**: Some code (like DB updates) is commented out - may need a cleanup or condition toggle.

### Improvement Ideas
*   **Encapsulate Globals**: Move all global flags and counters into instance variables or a configuration/state management class.
    
*   **Reduce Label Bloat**: Instead of passing 25 label objects, use a dictionary (`self.status_labels = {1: status_label1, ..., 25: status_label25}`) or a list to make handling dynamic and cleaner.
    
*   **Use Regex for Parsing**: Switch from hardcoded string matching to regular expressions for more robust data parsing.
    
*   **Thread Safety**: Use a `Lock` around any shared mutable state accessed by multiple threads.
    
*   **Unit Tests**: Separate parsing logic (e.g., `process_mac_address`) into pure functions so they can be easily unit-tested.
    
*   **Command Mapping**: Create a dictionary that maps keywords to handler functions to avoid long `if` chains.
    
*   **Structured Logging**: Use structured logs (e.g., JSON format or custom tags) for easier log parsing and analysis.
    
*   **Timeout/Watchdog**: Add a watchdog mechanism to detect if the device hangs or stops responding.
    
*   **Auto-Reconnect**: Implement auto-reconnect logic if the serial connection is lost.
    
*   **Debounce Repetitive Messages**: Implement logic to filter or debounce repeating messages that don't provide new info.

## **Servo Controller `servoControl.py`**
### Overview
The `ServoController` class provides a simple interface for controlling a servo motor via the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pin using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). It is designed to drive standard servo motors by translating a desired angle (0°–180°) into an appropriate PWM duty cycle.

### Purpose
This class is intended for controlling a servo motor on a Raspberry Pi. Typical use cases include:
*   Mechanically actuating a latch, arm, or lever
    
*   Setting a position in robotics or automation systems
    
*   Providing physical feedback or actuation in test rigs
    
It abstracts away low-level GPIO operations and allows users to control the servo using intuitive angles.

### Notes
*   **GPIO Pin**: Uses GPIO pin 12 (BCM numbering) for PWM output.
    
*   **PWM Frequency**: The PWM is set to 50Hz, which is standard for most hobby servos.
    
*   **Angle to Duty Cycle Mapping**: The formula used is:
    ```
    duty = 2 + ((angle / 180) * 10)
    ```
*   This maps 0° to ~2% and 180° to ~12% duty cycle, which fits typical servo control specs.
    
*   **No Input Validation**: There's no clamping or checking to prevent sending out-of-range angles (e.g., -10°, 200°).
    
*   **GPIO Cleanup**: The `stop()` method correctly stops PWM and cleans up GPIO to prevent conflicts or warnings.

### Improvement Ideas
- **Add Angle Validation**: Clamp `angle` between 0 and 180 to prevent invalid values from being sent to the servo:
   ```
   angle = max(0, min(180, angle))
   ```
- **Customizable Pin**: Let users specify the GPIO pin and frequency in `__init__()` instead of hardcoding:
   ```
   def __init__(self, pin=12, frequency=50):
   ```
- **Exception Handling**: Add basic exception handling in case GPIO fails to initialize or PWM throws an error.
- **Context Manager Support**: Make the class a context manager so it can automatically clean up:
   ```
   def __enter__(self): return self
   def __exit__(self, *args): self.stop()
   ```
*   **Verbose Mode/Logging**: Add a logging option to debug or trace servo movements.
    
*   **Dynamic Calibration**: Allow user to define the min/max duty cycle for better tuning across different servo models.

## **Setting Window `settingWindow.py`**
### Overview
The `SettingApp` class defines a Tkinter-based GUI for configuring and saving firmware-related address settings to a `config.ini` file. It allows users to input memory addresses for various components such as bootloader, firmware, and certificates, then persist those settings in a standard INI format.

### Purpose
This GUI tool is used to:
*   Provide a user-friendly interface to configure memory addresses for flashing operations.
    
*   Save those configurations to a local `config.ini` file, which other components in the flashing tool can read and use.
    
*   Ensure configuration is persistent across sessions and easily editable.

### Notes
*   **UI Elements**:
    *   Creates labels and text entry fields for six address-related parameters: Bootloader, Partition Table, OTA Data Initial, Firmware, Matter Cert, and AWS Cert.
        
    *   Includes a "Save" button to write the entries to a `config.ini` file.
        
    *   Displays a status label indicating whether the save operation was successful.
        
*   **INI File Handling**:
    *   Uses Python’s `configparser` to manage INI file content.
        
    *   Writes all entries to the `[Settings]` section of `config.ini`.
        
    *   If the file already exists, it updates the section; otherwise, it creates a new one.
        
*   **Path**: Assumes the `config.ini` file is located in the current working directory.
    
*   **No Input Validation**: There’s currently no checking for empty fields or invalid input (e.g., non-hex address formats).

### Improvement Ideas
**Input Validation**: Add checks to ensure each entry is in a valid format (e.g. hex, not blank).
   ```
   if not value.startswith("0x"):
    show_error("Address must start with 0x")
   ```
*   **Default Values**: Preload entries with current config values if `config.ini` already exists to support editing instead of starting blank each time.
    
*   **Dynamic Sections**: Support multiple profiles or sections beyond `[Settings]` for advanced configurations.
    
*   **Error Handling**: Add try/except blocks around file operations and parsing to handle IO errors gracefully.
    
*   **Confirmation Dialogs**: Use a pop-up message box for success/failure notifications instead of only the label.
    
*   **Use `ttk` for Modern UI**: Upgrade from `tk` to `ttk` widgets for cleaner visuals and better cross-platform appearance.
    
*   **Make Window Resizable/Responsive**: Currently the window size is fixed and not user-resizable, which might be annoying if labels or entries overflow.

## **Tools Bar `toolsbar.py`**
### Overview
`toolsbar.py` defines the `ToolsBar` class — a backend utility handler that provides functions for:
*   Verifying if `esptool.py` is installed.
    
*   Fetching device info from a local REST API.
    
*   Creating and populating a MySQL database with the fetched data.
    
*   Writing that data to a `.txt` file.
    
*   Displaying the data in logs.

### Purpose
The component serves as an automation utility in a firmware flashing tool by:
*   Validating tooling availability (`esptool.py`).
    
*   Integrating with a local server (e.g., Express backend on `localhost:3000`) to fetch device records.
    
*   Ensuring records are inserted into a structured MySQL database.
    
*   Persisting device data to a text file for traceability/logging.
    
*   Outputting all received data to the logger for easy debugging.

### Notes
**Functions:**
#### `flash_tool_checking()`

*   Runs `esptool.py --help` to ensure `esptool.py` is installed and executable.
    
*   Logs success or errors.
    

#### `download_list()`

*   Pulls JSON data from `http://localhost:3000/devices`.
    
*   Calls helper methods to:
    *   Ensure the DB table exists.
        
    *   Insert data.
        
    *   Write data to a `.txt` file.
        
    *   Log each record.
        

#### `create_table_if_not_exists()`

*   Connects to MySQL DB `device_mac_sn` using hardcoded credentials.
    
*   Creates a `device_info` table with necessary fields if not already present.
    

#### `insert_data(data)`

*   Inserts each record from the JSON list into the `device_info` table.
    
*   Expected keys: `matter_cert_id`, `serial_no`, `mac_address`, `matter_qr_string`, `status`.
    

#### `write_to_text_file(data)`

*   Writes structured info into `device_data.txt` located two levels up from script’s location.
    
*   Extracts keys like `order-no`, `mac-address`, `serial-id`, `cert-id`, etc.
    

#### `display_data(data)`

*   Outputs each record’s info using `logger.info()` for visibility/debugging.

### Improvement Ideas
*   **Security**
    *   **DO NOT** hardcode DB credentials — read them from a `.env` file or a secure config.
        
    *   Mask sensitive logs (like passwords or MAC addresses if needed).
        
*   **Code Cleanup**
    *   Refactor repetitive code (DB connection logic, file writing) into helper methods.
        
    *   Remove commented-out legacy sections.
        
*   **Robustness**
    *   Add retry logic for failed HTTP or DB connections.
        
    *   Validate the JSON structure before using `.get()` to avoid unexpected formats.
        
*   **Unit Testing**
    *   Break out and test each method with mock inputs.
        
    *   Especially `insert_data()` and `write_to_text_file()` for proper data integrity.
        
*   **Portability**
    *   Replace static URL (`http://localhost:3000/devices`) with a configurable option.

### Dependencies
*   `subprocess` for CLI command execution.
    
*   `requests` for HTTP requests.
    
*   `mysql.connector` for DB interaction.
    
*   `os` and `logging` for filesystem and logs.

## **Update To Database `updateDB.py`**
### Overview
`updateDB.py` contains the `UpdateDB` class, which is responsible for:
- Updating the MAC address and device status in **MySQL database**.
- Updating the MAC address in a **local text file** (`device_data.txt`).

This is used to track which devices have been flashed with which MAC addresses, and to ensure data consistency between the DB and log file.

### Purpose
- `update_database(mac_address)`
   Updates the first unused entry in the `device_info` table (`status=0`) with the new MAC address and marks it as used (`status=1`).
- `update_text_file(mac_address)`
   Modifies the first unused line in the `device_data.txt` file by replacing its MAC address field with the new value.

### Notes
*   Uses **MySQL Connector** to interact with the database.
    
*   Locates the `device_data.txt` file using a path relative to the script location.
    
*   Uses logging throughout the code for debugging and traceability.
    
*   Only updates the **first** available (unused) row in both the database and file, although the file logic doesn't fully reflect that yet.
    
*   Contains commented-out and redundant error handling code, which should be cleaned.

### Improvement Ideas
| Area | Issue | Suggestion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SQL query** | Updates all rows with `status = 0` | Add `ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 1` to safely update one row |
| **Text file update** | Doesn’t actually append updated line | Re-enable `updated_lines.append(updated_line)` and add `\n` manually |
| **Logic flow** | May update multiple lines if they contain `'mac-address:'` | Add `found = True` + `break` after the first update |
| **Error handling** | Duplicate `except IOError` blocks | Remove one of them to clean up the logic |
| **Status field in file** | Not updating `Status: 0` → `Status: 1` | Uncomment and handle it like the MAC update |
| **Logging** | Logs are minimal in the file section | Add more context (e.g., which line was updated) |

## **Uploading Report `uploadReport.py`**
### Overview
`uploadReport.py` defines **a single function** called `post_report()` that is intended to send data to an **API** using an HTTP POST request.

However, this component is currently not used anywhere in the codebase.

### Purpose
`post_report(api_url, data, headers=None)`
- Post JSON data to the specified API endpoint using the `requests` library.
- Handles exceptions and logs both success and failure cases.
- Returns the response object on success or `None` if an error occurs.

### Notes
- Uses Python's built-in `logging` for structured output.
- Uses `raise_for_status()` to catch HTTP errors automatically.
- Accepts custom headers, but they're optional - defaults to `None`.

This is a pretty standard wrapper around `requests.post()` with logging and exeption handling.

### Improvement Ideas
| Area | Issue | Suggestion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Usage** | Currently unused | Either remove the file or wire it into a real reporting flow (e.g., after firmware flash, test results, etc.) |
| **Error Handling** | Uses `print()` alongside `logger.error()` | Ditch `print()` — use logging only for consistency |
| **Testability** | No retry or timeout handling | Add timeout and optional retry mechanism for robustness |
| **Return Value** | Returns `None` on error | Consider returning an error structure or message instead for better debugging from calling code |

## **Wifi Driver `wifiDriver.py`**
### Overview
`wifiDriver.py` is a **standalone utility script** for scanning Wi-Fi networks and checking signal strength (RSSI) using Linux commands like `iwlist` and `iwconfig`. It can fallback to a secondary interface if the default fails.

### Purpose
1. `scan_wifi_networks(interface='wlan0', fallback_interface='wlp44s0')`
    - Uses `iwlist scan` to list available Wi-Fi SSIDs and their signal strength.
2. `run_iwconfig(interface=`wlan0')`
    - Uses `iwconfig` to get the current Wi-Fi network and its signal level.
3. Script behavior under `if __name__ == "__main__"`
    - Scans for Wi-Fi, looks for a specific SSID at (`AT-MT:Y1CA00O6148F--405J10`),and checks if its RSSI is within a usable range (`-30` to `-110` dBm).

### Notes
*   Hardcoded SSID in the main block is specific to your factory test environment.
    
*   Uses `subprocess` to call system utilities — no dependencies outside the Python standard library.
    
*   Fallback interface improves resilience in dual-interface setups.

### Improvement Ideas
| Area | Issue | Suggestion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hardcoding** | Hardcoded SSID in the main block | Move target SSID to a config or pass as CLI arg/env var |
| **Logging** | Uses `print()` for debugging/errors | Replace all `print()` with `logging` for consistency and better control |
| **Fallback Interface** | Could recurse infinitely if fallback also fails | Add a limit to prevent potential infinite fallback |
| **Parsing Fragility** | Regex parsing of CLI output is brittle | Consider switching to `iw dev wlan0 scan` (more modern) or using `pyroute2` for more structured parsing |
| **Error Handling** | Doesn't catch `FileNotFoundError` if `iwlist` or `iwconfig` is missing | Add specific exception for missing commands |
| **Unit Testing** | Not testable in current form | Break into smaller testable units, mock subprocess calls in tests |

## **Write Device Information `writeDeviceInfo.py`**
### Overview
`writeDeviceInfo.py` is a Python class component used to manage device information transmission over a serial connection in a GUI-based factory application. It handles sending commands like product names, serial numbers (SRN), and Matter QR (MTQR) data to connected devices. It also updates the statuses of each step in a local text file (`device_data.txt`) to track progress through predefined states (Status: 1 → 2 → 3).

### Purpose
The main purpose of this module is to:
*   Send structured commands to a device via a serial interface.
    
*   Read serial numbers and MTQR strings from a local text file based on specific status markers.
    
*   Mark those entries as "used" by updating their status in the file.
    
*   Update the UI to reflect the success/failure of each operation through provided status labels.

### Notes
*   The script is tightly coupled with the `device_data.txt` structure and assumes it contains lines with fields like `serial-id:` and `qrcode:`, each ending with a `Status:` marker.
    
*   The `send_command()` function is expected to interface with the device, probably via UART.
    
*   Multiple lines of code are commented out, indicating ongoing development or debugging.
    
*   The script assumes consistent file access — it will break silently if the file format changes or permissions are wrong.
    
*   `status_label1` and `status_label2` are likely `tkinter.Label` widgets (or similar), suggesting the script is part of a GUI workflow.

### Improvement Ideas
| **Category** | **Improvement** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Code Structure** | Separate file I/O logic | Create a dedicated class or module to handle reading and writing `device_data.txt`. |
|  | Remove redundant file operations | Abstract repeated open/read/write blocks into reusable functions. |
|  | Fix duplicate function definition | `send_serial_number_command()` is defined twice—keep one and clean up. |
| **Maintainability** | Use constants or config file | Extract hardcoded strings (e.g., `"serial-id:"`, `"Status: 1"`) and file paths into constants. |
|  | Clear commented-out code | Remove or label with `# TODO:` to reduce confusion. |
| **Error Handling** | Handle file access errors more gracefully | Display user-facing errors (e.g., pop-ups or GUI label updates) when file operations fail. |
|  | Validate file content format | Add checks for malformed lines or missing keys like `serial-id` or `qrcode`. |
| **User Experience** | Improve GUI feedback | Show real-time status/logs in the GUI, not just via `logger`. |
|  | Disable UI elements during operations | Prevent double sending or multiple clicks while commands are running. |
| **Testing** | Add unit tests for file functions | Mock the text file and test `get_serial_number_from_text_file()` and others under various scenarios. |
| **Readability** | Add inline comments and docstrings | Help future devs understand what each method is doing at a glance. |
